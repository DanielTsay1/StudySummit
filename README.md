Why was Adapt made?
As students ourselves, we struggle finding information, resources and study techniques. We wanted to make a resource that not only benefits us but every student in the world, regardless of economic status. Thus, Adapt was created, with the main purpose of providing free online resources and making studying efficient and effective. Adapt was an award winning hackathon project that we decided to take further to not only help students but also improve our programming skills.

What is Adapt?

Adapt is an all-in-one resource hub where students can find everything they need to thrive in their studies:

Free Online Resources: We help students discover a wide range of free materials tailored specifically for both general courses and AP courses, helping students prepare for their big tests.

Study Tips and Strategies: Our platform provides students with valuable insights on how to study smarter, not harder. From time management tips to test-taking strategies, we’ve got it covered. 

Adapt Study: This feature allows students to engage in structured study sessions, reinforcing their learning and improving retention. We provide various tools such as a timer, to-do list, calculator and a music player all of which we programmed from scratch. Additionally, we have various backgrounds that a student can study in for example a cafe or a beach.

Project: As a project we will be constantly improving Adapt so that it fits the needs of our users. We will be making constant changes to better Adapt by obtaining feedback from teachers, students, and professors. As of right now we have had a Microsoft Software Engineer review our work and talk us through the process of creating something new.

We wish to grow this project further and get more out of just a learning experience. We want to give the chance for everyone to use our website so that they can furhter their learning.

AdaptStudy
AdaptStudy is our main focus where we provide a easy to use study "room" with musics, to do lists, live backgrounds and more! We are currently working on making the AdaptStudy feature much better and more refined so that it feels like a premuim experience.

Thank you for considering Adapt as a partner in your students' academic journey. Together, we can help them achieve their full potential and score ONE MILLION!
