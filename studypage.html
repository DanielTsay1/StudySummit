                    Our website offers links to completely free resources to study for a diverse range of classes. Made by high school AP students, who know the 
                    struggles of finding free and reliable study material for the exams. This guide will go into detail on how to navigate these resources,
                    as well as how to study and utilize these resources effectively. Let the learning begin!

                <div class = "section-content">
                    The Pomodoro Technique is an approach to studying 
                    that involves studying in intervals of 
                    25 minutes work sessions seperated by short breaks of 5 minutes. 
                     After completing typically four sessions, a
                      longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. This technique maximizes productivity, concentration and
                      motivation throughout the study session.

                <div class = "section-content">
                    Active recall is a study technique where you retrieve information
                    from memory without relying on external aids like notes or textbooks. 
                    Typically this is done through flashcards or Quizlet.
                    This method encourages deeper engagement with the material and 
                    enhances long-term retention of the information being studied.

                <div class = "section-content">
                    Spaced repetition is a study technique involving reviewing information in spaced intervals over time.
                    This method leverages the spacing effect, which suggests that
                    information is better retained when repeated over spaced intervals rather
                    than in a single session. As a result, spaced repetition is able to optimize
                    long-term memory retention while minimizing the time needed for review.

                    The Feynman Technique is a learning method centered around the
                    concept of teaching a subject to someone else. By teaching the material you 
                    are forced to confront any gaps in understanding.
                    The act of explaining the topic helps solidify
                    one's own understanding and retention of the material.

                    While there are many ways and strategies to approach studying, in the end you have
                    to find what works for you. It may involve testing many techniques or creating your
                    own, but find a technique that works for you and that you can stick to. A universal 
                    tip for all students taking tests is to take practice tests at least a week before 
                    the actual test. The law of specificity says that if you want to get better at something, 
                    you need to practice that exact thing. This means taking timed practice tests if 
                    that is what you are practicing for. Especially AP students, practice tests will
                    carry you to your desired score. Armed with this information, we hope you find
                    this website useful! Happy studying!!
